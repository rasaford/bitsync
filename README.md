# Bitsync 
> The title is still WIP

Fast, distributed file synchronozation between all connected devices.

This is in a very early stage of development.

## Goals
- [ ] Peer to peer file synchonization
- [ ] Peer discovery without a tracker
- [ ] Very fast performance (ideally limited by network interface / disk)
- [ ] Secure end to end encryption of all files
- [ ] Easy to use CLI
- [ ] Trivial to install and get started
- [ ] No internet connection required (local peer discovery)
- [ ] Good documentation
- [ ] Readable code :wink:
